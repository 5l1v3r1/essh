# Using Drivers

Drivers in Essh are templates to construct script in tasks execution.
Essh usually executes tasks by using built-in default driver. But you can also use your custom drivers.

This is an advanced topic. For more information on drivers, see the [Drivers](/docs/en/drivers.html) section.

## Next Steps

In the [Introduction](/intro/en/index.html) guide, I have explained the basic features of Essh. If you want to get in-depth information about Essh, read the [documentation](/docs/en/index.html).

Enjoy!
